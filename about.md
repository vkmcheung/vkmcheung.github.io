### Short Academic Biography
I'm a doctoral student based in the Department of Neuropsychology at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en) in [Leipzig, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig). My research focuses on understanding how the brain makes predictions in music. Right now, I am investigating syntactic predictions in Western tonal harmony using behavioural measures and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The ultimate goal is to identify and understand the underlying neural mechanisms that support our appreciation and pleasure that we get from listening to music - based on what we have heard and practiced throughout our lives.

Because of my background in mathematics and computational neuroscience, I also like to try out novel computational techniques when analysing my data. 

Before moving to Leipzig, I did a masters in computational neuroscience at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience (BCCN)](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/Home/?languageId=1)) in [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), where I made the transition from proving mathematical theorems on a daily basis to learning about how to [play pinball without hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIIffTH5D-E) (with Brain-Computer Interface), artificial neural networks, cognitive models in learning, amongst other things. During that time I also had the chance to do an overseas lab-rotation at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in [Montreal, QC, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal), where I helped out on coding and setting up a behavioural experiment on musical prediction errors.

Even before that I was doing an undergraduate masters degree in mathematics at the [University of Warwick](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/) in [Coventry (not Warwick!), UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry). The breadth of research interests in the department meant that I could learn about pretty much anything from Brownian Motion to PDEs to Theoretical Neuroscience. And after spending the summer of my third year doing undergraduate research on sparse-random spiking neural networks and eventually continuing it onto my final-year project, I decided it was time to move on.

For more about my life before and beyond that, see my [personal page](personal.md).
