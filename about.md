### Short Biography
I'm a doctoral student based in the Department of Neuropsychology at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en) in [Leipzig, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig). My research focuses on understanding how the brain makes predictions in music. Right now, I am investigating syntactic predictions in Western tonal harmony using behavioural measures and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in musicians and non-musicians. The ultimate goal is to identify and understand the underlying neural mechanisms that support our appreciation and pleasure that we get from listening to music - based on what we have heard and practiced throughout our lives.
