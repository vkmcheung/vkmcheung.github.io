# Welcome to my home page

This is still under progress!

Eventually you should be able to find the following:
- something [about me](about.md)
- some [more things about me](personal.md) not related to work
- some of my papers (ha!)
- some of my [code](code.md)

You can also:
- see my page at the [Max Planck Institute](http://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/cheung/162350)
- see my profile at the [Croucher Foundation](https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/scholars/vincent-ka-ming-cheung) and [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent_Cheung8)
- trace my [neuroscientific ancestry](https://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=675381)
